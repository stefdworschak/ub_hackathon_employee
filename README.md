## Project Scope

### User Stories

#### CEO / company

- As CEO/company, I want to be able to easily create an Employee Stock Ownership Program, so that I reward my employees with equity shares and increase employee retention.
- As CEO/company, I want to be able to monitor and adjust my equity distribution, create new share types and add/remove employees to the plan, so that I can easily manage my companyâ€™s ESOP.

#### Employee

- As an employee/shareholder, I want to be able to see my equity share and monitor trends, so that I can see my stake in the company and my personal gains.
